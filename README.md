# OpenDSA

A lightweight, generic collection of data structures and algoritms written in C++. The project is inspired from [the C++ STL](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container) but with a simplified approach.

> This repository serves solely for the purpose of learning how the C++ STL is implemented. For pracitcal uses, please refer to [the C++ STL](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container) for efficiency and safety.

## Containers

`opendsa` supports many data structures (or _containers_) that are inspired from the C++ STL as well as other useful data structures such as trie and AVL tree.

### Sequence container

1. Vector ([_doc_](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector)): a contiguous array that can grows and shrinks

2. Deque ([doc](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/deque)): a _doubly-ended queue_
